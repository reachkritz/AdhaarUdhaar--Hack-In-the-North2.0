# Aadhaar Udhaar

# What is Aadhaar?
Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Indian government to every individual resident of India.
Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system, with over 1.123 billion enrolled members as of 28 February 2017. Hence Aadhaar is called "Aam Aadmi Ka Adhikaar".

# Basic idea behind our application
We are trying to revolutionise the concept of the prevalent pen-paper borrow-lending system through developing an android application to manage the borrow and lending operations on the go along with the integration of Aadhar Card authentication of users. Basically, our application has a borrow - lend interface where any user can save records of people whom he has lent money or from whom he has borrowed some amount. Anyone who borrows money from another user must provide his Aadhaar QR code as an identity proof. The QR code on the Aadhaar Card is scanned and all the relevant information about the user like his name, address, UID etc. is displayed onto the mobile screen of the lender. Hence, the lender can easily store the entry of the borrower along with the amount he has borrowed.

# How our app solves the problem of Common Man?
This application is useful for people who run businesses like canteens, general stores and many other vendors who face problems when their customers buy stuff and decide to pay later. In such cases, they usually maintain a record of the customer transactions on paper. This method is susceptible to many fraudulent cases like fake identiy of customers, impersonation of a person with someone else's name, etc. Our application eradiactes this problem by authenticating the customers through Aadhaar Card (which is unique for every person and cannot be duplicated) and fetching all the relevant details about the customer - hence removing the hassle of maintaining a physical register for a "COMMON MAN" .
